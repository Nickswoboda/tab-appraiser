# Tab Appraiser
Tab Appraiser is an overlay stash tab price checker for the game [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).

The overlay uses the [pathofexile.com](https://www.pathofexile.com/) and [poe.ninja](poe.ninja) APIs to check item prices of a stash tab, displaying the information on top of the Path of Exile application.

## Notes
- The program only supports price checking of items with static values. Prices for Rare items, 6-links, skill gems, etc. are not supported.
